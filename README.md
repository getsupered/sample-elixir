# Demo

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4050`](http://localhost:4050) from your browser.

## Dependencies

I recommend asdf version manager to help manage Elixir and NodeJS versions. You can find the versions that were used to write this in `.tool-versions`.

Other versions may work as well, if you have a different way of managing them.
